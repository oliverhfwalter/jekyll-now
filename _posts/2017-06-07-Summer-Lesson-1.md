    <td>Not being able to remember how you create or change certain parts of my website from my last website limited me as I wanted to copy some of the aspects of my old blog onto my new one, such as a transparent layer so my my website look more professional. 

I need to work on note taking as if I had done this it would have to much easier to do parts of my website again.

Also the speed of my Github website itself slowed my down as I didn't know if the changes I had made had actually worked. </td>
