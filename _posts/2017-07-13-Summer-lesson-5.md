  <tr>
    <td>L earnt effectively my reading what was on classroom and copying that format of that function and then I just changed the units in the function each time to get it to convert the units it had to.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Not much limited my learning as I was familiar with unit convert using python 3 to code as we did this in the lesson before, however we did a simpler converter that did not use functions.

I could work on collaboration more as I finished my work quite quickly so I could have shared my knowledge with others around me more as it would have helped them finish too.  </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will collaborate more so people around me will help me when I need help, as I could have helped them in this lesson. So that we all completed the work quicker.  </td>
