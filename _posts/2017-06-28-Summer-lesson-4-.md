    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mainly by listening to alex tell me what the task was and how to make a code that could effectively convert to an accurate amount of decimal places. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I should work on perseverance as if I asked about what the task was then worked by myself i probably would have learnt more and still got the same outcome. Lack of python knowledge limited my learning as I didn't know what some of the code that the people around me used was. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will work individually for longer at the beginning before I asked for help. Also if I read through the brief again and in more detail I would have had a better idea of what the task was and had a better idea of where to start. </td>
