  <tr>
    <td>partially by focused listening and watching a demonstration. But mainly by applying past knowledge from the last time we used python 3 to make a program for a restaurant and to made a A.I. 
Also I learnt by collaboration working with the people around me as we made quicker progress when we did this.
